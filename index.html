        <p>
          Long before Barton Springs Pool was built, the springs were considered
          sacred and were used for purification rituals by the Tonkawa Native
          American tribe who inhabited the area. Spanish explorers first found
          the springs in the 17th century, and around 1730 erected temporary
          missions at the site (later moving to San Antonio). In 1837, soon
          after incorporation of the city of Austin, William ("Uncle Billy")
          Barton, the springs' namesake, settled the area. Barton named the
          three separate springs after his three daughters: Parthenia, Eliza,
          and Zenobia. He, and subsequent owners of the property, recognized its
          value as a tourist attraction, and promoted it vigorously, thus
          leading to the swimming hole's lasting popularity. The last private
          owner of the property, Andrew Jackson Zilker, deeded it to Austin in
          1918. During the 1920s, the city undertook a construction project to
          create a larger swimming area by damming the springs and building
          sidewalks. The bathhouse was designed in 1947 by Dan Driscoll, who
          also designed the bathhouse at Deep Eddy Pool.
